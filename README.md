# Immersive Engineering Education Tools

This repository contains two interactive 3D applications designed to enhance electrical engineering education using Unity and immersive technologies.

## üîß Projects Overview

### 1. üì± Induction Motor AR App (Android)
An augmented reality application that recognizes 2D diagrams of induction motors and renders them as interactive 3D models in real time.

- **Platform:** Android
- **Tech Stack:** Unity, ARCore, Blender
- **Features:**
  - Real-time 2D diagram recognition
  - Interactive 3D motor model with normal and exploded views
  - Swipe gestures and joystick controls
  - Lightweight performance on common Android devices

### 2. üñ•Ô∏è Substation Walkthrough (Windows)
A 3D immersive desktop application that allows users to freely explore a virtual electrical substation from a third-person perspective.

- **Platform:** Windows PC
- **Tech Stack:** Unity, Blender
- **Features:**
  - Optimized 3D substation model with interaction zones
  - Game-like controls (WASD + mouse)
  - On-trigger UI prompts with component info
  - Environmental enhancements (trees, lighting) for immersion
